# AnotherTaskList
A task list to demonstrate my skills in React and Redux

I intend to write a simple task list with React and Redux.
Each list item will have 
- title
- category
- description
- date added
- date due
- date completed
- notes

The user will be able to write a new list item, prioritize the list item, check the item off as done, or delete the item entirely. The user will also be able to update properties on existing list items. Within each category, the user will be able to sort the lists alphabetically, or by date added/due/completed. 

This app will render as an empty task list for the user to populate.
The app will also have a pre-populated list that a user can click into and play with merely for the purposes of exploring the app.
